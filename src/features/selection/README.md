# Features Selection Module

This module is part of a larger framework designed to enhance the process of detecting deepfake audio by strategically selecting and refining audio features.

## Purpose

The `features.selection` module aids in optimizing the feature set used for training machine learning models by identifying the most impactful features and reducing redundancy within the data. This improves model accuracy and efficiency.

## Feature Selection Methods

### Filter Methods
Filter methods involve selecting features based on their statistical scores in relation to the target variable. These methods are generally fast and effective at identifying the most relevant individual features, using tests such as correlation coefficients, Chi-squared test, and mutual information scores.

### Wrapper Methods
Wrapper methods use a predictive model to score feature subsets and select the best-performing combination based on model accuracy. This method iteratively creates models using different subsets of features, such as forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination.

### Embedded Methods
Embedded methods integrate the feature selection process as part of the model training. The model decides which features are important during the learning process. Common examples include regularization methods like Lasso and decision tree-based methods like feature importance from Random Forests.

## Components

### Directory Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the `features.selection` package, making its classes and functions available for import.
- `feature_selection.py`: Contains functions that utilize embedded and wrapper methods to select important features based on their impact on model performance.
- `remove_redundant_features.py`: Implements filter methods to eliminate features that are highly correlated or have minimal variance.
- `statistical_tests.py`: Performs statistical tests to assess the significance of different features, aiding in their selection.

## Key Functions

- **select_important_features**: This function uses a RandomForestClassifier, an example of an embedded method, to determine the importance of features. It retains those that have a significant impact on the target variable.
  
- **remove_highly_correlated_features**: Reduces feature redundancy by removing features that are highly correlated, ensuring the dataset does not have multicollinear features, typically using filter methods.
  
- **perform_statistical_tests**: Conducts various statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) to evaluate the differences in distributions of features between real and fake audio samples.


This module simplifies the process of feature selection, enabling more effective and efficient predictive modeling, crucial for tasks such as deepfake detection in audio samples.
